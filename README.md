# Description

This PCL & ROS project serves as a proof of concept for an autonomous vehicle to perform segmentation and clustering on moving cars & objects from the surrounding. The real world data set is obtained from a well-known benchmark
for computer vision tasks in autonomous driving - The KITTI dataset can be accessed and downloaded from the [KITTI dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/).
